## **Abstract:** <br>

_When we shoot pictures through transparent media, such as glass, reflection can undesirably occur, obscuring the scene we intended to capture. Therefore, removing reflection is practical in image restoration. However, a reflective scene mixed with that behind the glass is challenging to be separated, considered significantly ill-posed. This letter addresses the single image reflection removal (SIRR) problem by proposing a knowledge-distilling-based content disentangling model that can effectively decompose the transmission and reflection layers. The experiments on benchmark SIRR datasets demonstrate that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art SIRR methods._
